# Face_Recognition_using_Transfer_Learning

This task is all about to use the pre-trained model like VGG16/VGG19/MobileNet/ResNet architecture to create our own model to predict something.
Here we are freezing those layers, which we don't want to retrain, because we only want to retrain the last layer as our concern.
# we are Utilizing the power of VGG, we just add one more fully connected layer(FCL) to this model.
